Firewall Filtering Summary:
A firewall controls network traffic by applying rules to allow or block packets based on criteria like port, protocol, or IP address. Windows Firewall filters inbound and outbound traffic using predefined or custom rules. In this task, I blocked inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet) to prevent unauthorized access, then tested and removed the rule to restore the original state.
